            <h1 id="title">Tribute to linux</h1>
            <p>Linux, born in 1991, is the brainchild of Finnish software engineer Linus Torvalds. Torvalds, then a computer
                science student, sought to create a free and open-source alternative to the UNIX operating system.
                Frustrated with the licensing restrictions of existing options, he began working on his project.</p>
            <p>On August 25, 1991, Linus Torvalds made an announcement on a Usenet newsgroup, sharing the initial version of
                his operating system kernel. He named it "Freax," a combination of "free," "freak," and the customary 'x' at
                the end of UNIX. The kernel quickly gained attention from the open-source community.</p>
            <p>In the following years, Linux evolved through collaboration with a growing community of developers worldwide.
                The GNU General Public License (GPL) was instrumental in shaping Linux's development philosophy, ensuring
                that the source code remained freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.</p>
            <p>Linux became the cornerstone of various operating systems, known as Linux distributions or distros. Popular
                distros include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and CentOS, each tailored to specific user preferences and needs.
            </p>
            <p>Renowned for its stability, security, and scalability, Linux found its place not only in server environments
                but also in desktop computing and embedded systems. Its versatility has made it a favorite among developers,
                powering a significant portion of the internet's infrastructure and supporting a wide array of devices, from
                smartphones to supercomputers.
            </p>
            <p>Over the years, Linux has become a symbol of the open-source movement, embodying the collaborative spirit of
                developers worldwide working towards a shared goal. Linus Torvalds' creation has left an indelible mark on
                the world of technology, challenging the status quo and showcasing the potential of community-driven
                innovation.</p>
